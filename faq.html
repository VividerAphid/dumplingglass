    <h4>What area do you service?</h4>
    <p>We are based out of Greenwood Indiana, so anywhere within around 2 hours of there we can work something out in person. 
        Typically we will start our exchange through emails and then over text and/or phone calls to get the finer details worked out. 
        Sometimes there is no need to meet in person if you have the exact measurements and know just what you want. 
        However, to avoid shipping cost and risk it is optimal to meet somewhere to receive your piece. 
        If you live out of state or quite far from us, we will still be happy to work with you, just bear with us as we navigate shipping!
    </p> 

    <h4>Do you install the glasswork?</h4>
    <p>We will work with an installer/handyman of your choice to help you get your piece installed.</p>

    <h4>How do you price the stained glass?</h4>
    <p>Each piece is priced by a variety of factors (the type and color of glass we use, the size and complexity of the piece, 
        and the finish chosen) that we can change and adapt depending on your budget.</p>

    <h4>How does the design process work for custom pieces?</h4>
    <p>This process depends on how specific or open the client is to certain patterns or designs. Typically, we will work together to get a basic idea of the design, 
        and then the glass artist will draw up a few design options to choose from. You can also send us inspiration pictures or your own sketched out ideas to convey your vision.
        We will also share pictures of the glass we will use to make sure it is just what you want and you can get excited for it.</p>

    <h4>Do you use lead solder in your work?</h4>
    <p>Yes and no. We have the ability to use either type depending on what the client wants and the location of the piece. 
        Traditional solder is made of lead and tin, and gives the most options for patinas at the end (if you want the solder lines to look a color other than silver). 
        However, we typically use lead free solder unless the client wants a copper finish.
    </p> 

    <h4>Do you do stained glass repair as well?</h4>
    <p>We typically do not do stained glass repair. Repairing is a whole different beast to tackle and is often too large a scale for us.
         If you have a small piece with very minor injuries, feel free to reach out and we may give it a try.
    </p>

    <h4>What are the main techniques of stained glass?</h4>
    <p>There are two main techniques that most artists use when assembling stained glass work; copper foiling, and came.
        Copper foiling involves wrapping each piece of glass in copper foil tape and then soldering it all together. 
        Since the solder won’t stick to the glass, we use the foil as our little sandwich filling to glue it all together. 
        The other technique is the came method. For this, strips of metal with slots in the middle are stretched around the pieces of glass and soldered together. 
        The slots in the metal are designed for the glass to slip into to hold it in place. 
        This method can be weatherproofed so it can survive the elements outside.
    </p> 

    <h4>What method do you use, foiling or came?</h4>
    <p>We generally use the foiling method. 
        We would be happy to work with you if you’d like a piece to go outside or enjoy the look of the came method better.
    </p>

    <h4>How long does it take to make a piece of stained glass?</h4>
    <p>Making a stained glass window can take anywhere from 10-100 hours, just depending on the size and complexity of the piece.
         The nicer you are to the stained glass artist, the faster she will get it done!
    </p>

    <h4>Do you make 3D pieces?</h4>
    <p>If you can dream it, we can do our best to make it. 
        We would love to get creative with you to try and bring the dreams in your head to life.
