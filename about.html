          The whole adventure began when the Dumpling Investment crew restored a beautiful old house from 1935. We realized quickly that the house needed some stained glass to accent its features, but purchasing most custom pieces were way out of the budget. 
          Luckily, passed down through the family was a large tote of beautiful stained glass and some beginning supplies. 
          The tote waited patiently for years to be inherited by the right person, and it finally found its home; right in a cozy garage in Greenwood.

          Shelby, the main stained glass artist began the quest of making majestic stained glass transoms and windows for the old house. 
           After many hours of reading, watching videos, and making a mess of the garage workshop, she developed a good feel for how to make the art she wanted. 
           By the time the pieces were finished, the idea for Dumpling Glass was born! 
           We want to be able to modernize stained glass art and make it more available to everyday people. 
           As it is typically very expensive and mostly found in churches or fancy buildings, our goals are to provide a more flexible price range and more modern styles to fit todays homes better.

        <h4>Sean</h4>
        <p>The general handyman. He has been building and refinishing beautiful wooden projects for many years, and has been the frame builder for most windows I make. This man cannot tell the difference between pink and purple, but can match stain and wood colors the best I've ever seen. This expertise allows us to do broader custom work as we can even make you a frame to put anywhere you want. Sean also plays a cheerleader role and has provided the funding and foundation for Shelby to learn all she knows.</p>
